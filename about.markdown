My name is Alip; I'm a backend software engineer at foodpanda APAC. Currently, I'm staying in Singapore. I will use my blog to share some of the daily cases that I found, and I feel it's exciting.

You can reach me on my [Github](https://github.com/alipsidikp), [Facebook](https://www.facebook.com/alip.sidik), or [LinkedIn](https://id.linkedin.com/in/alipsidik).
